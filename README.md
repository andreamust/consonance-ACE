## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/andreamust/consonance-ACE.git
   cd consonance-ACE
   ```

2. Create the conda environment (Python 3.11):

   ```bash
   conda create -n ace python=3.11
   conda activate ace
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Preparation

Our experiments use chord annotations and audio from:

* Training / Validation:
    * Isophonics dataset
    * McGill Billboard corpus

* Testing:
    * RWC Pop dataset
    * USPop dataset

Chord annotations are sourced from [ChoCo: the Chord Corpus](https://github.com/andreamust/ChoCo).

Prepare the dataset features by running:

```bash
python ACE/preprocess_data.py
```

This generates cache files containing both the preprocessed audio features and chord labels. Parameters for the preprocessing script can be adjusted in `ACE/preprocess/dataset.gin`.

## ðŸš€ Training
To train a model, run:

```bash
python -m ACE.trainer --model model_name --name run_name
```
* `--model`: choose between
    * `conformer`: baseline classification model 
    * `conformer_decomposed`: decomposition-based proposed in the paper. 

* `--name`: optional, used for logging the run on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).

## ðŸŽ¯ Models
Two models are implemented in this repository:

* `conformer`: baseline architecture for chord classification (170 classes).
* `conformer_decomposed`: our proposed model, predicting root, bass, and pitch activations separately.

The `conformer_decomposed` model introduces several key innovations:

1. **Decomposed Output Heads**: Instead of a single output layer for all chord classes, we use separate heads for root, bass, and chord tones, allowing for more specialized learning.
2. **Consonance Label Smoothing**: adds music-theory informed smoothing, improving robustness and harmonic plausibility.

Models are stored in the `ACE/models` directory, which also contains `.gin` configuration files for each model.

## ðŸ”® Inference

TBD

<!-- To run inference with a trained model, use the following command:

```bash
python -m ACE.inference --model model_name --input audio_file
```

* `model_name`: specify the model to use (either `conformer` or `conformer_decomposed`).
* `audio_file`: path to the audio file for which to predict chord labels. -->
